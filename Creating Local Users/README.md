# Creating Local Users
A shell script that adds users to the same Linux system as the script is executed on.

## Case Scenario for using this script
Imagine that you're working as a Linux System Administrator for a fast-growing company. The latest company initiative requires you to build and deploy dozens of servers. You're falling behind schedule and are going to miss your deadline for these new server deployments because you are **`constantly being interrupted by the help desk calling you to create new Linux accounts for all the people in the company`** who have been recruited to test out the company's newest Linux-based application. To meet your deadline and keep your sanity, you decide to **`write a shell script that will create new user accounts`**. Once you're done with the shell script you can put the help desk in charge of creating new accounts which will finally allow you to work uninterrupted and complete your server deployments on time.
